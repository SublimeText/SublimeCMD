SublimeCMD
==========

A simple command processor for Sublime Text.


The Problem
***********

The Python console is very cumbersome to use for a number of common tasks. A
dedicated command processor for these task can improve the experience.


Feature Overview
****************

   - Commands to explore settings, commands and keybindings, and to run commands
     conveniently by name.
   - Integration with PowershellUtils package (if available).
   - Integration with UberSelection package (if available).

How to Use
**********

Intrinsic Commands
******************

Syntax:

   - ``<COMMAND>[<MODIFIERS>] <ARGUMENTS>``

At the moment, an argument is always required, even if it's ignored. Some
arguments may be simple patterns like ``hell? world`` or ``hell? w*``.

``run``
   Runs or searches commands depending on the modifiers.

``set``
   Sets or searches settings depending on the modifiers.

Modifiers
---------

``?``
   Performs a query based on the argument.

``!``
   Generally forces verbose output from queries. If combined with query, must
   always precede ``?``.

``:w|a``
   Applies command to window or application. By default, commands are applied
   to the current view.


Examples
--------

::

   set word_wrap False

This command modifies the setting for the view in the current session.

::
   
   set? word_wrap

This command shows the setting's value in the status bar.

::

   set!? w*

This command plots all declared values for all settings beggining with ``w`` in
the order they are applied.

::

   run:w increase_font_size

This command runs the given argument as a window command.

::

   run!? .

This command shows all found commands. Note the argument is ignored.
